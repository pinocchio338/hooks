# Lifting state

## Background

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) which
basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the two
components and placing the state management there, and then passing the state
and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need it.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we've got a new feature request for the `Display` component.
They want us to display the `animal` the user selects. But that state is managed
in a "sibling" component, so we have to move that management to the least common
parent (`App`) and then pass it down.

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ colocating state

As a community weâ€™re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).
In this extra credit, we'll pretend that we want to restore the original
behavior for the display component:

```javascript
function Display({name}) {
  return <div>{`Hey ${name}, you are great!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it.

ðŸ’° If that's confusing, you can basically undo all your changes and that's it...
But try to actually do that work manually to get a feel for it.
