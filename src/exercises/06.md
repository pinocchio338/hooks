### The `useReducer` hook

The `useReducer` hook is another way to manage state in React. In fact,
`useState` is built on top of `useReducer`.

Here's an example of how you might use the `useReducer` hook for our old counter
example component:

```javascript
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': {
      return {count: state.count + 1}
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
    }
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const initialState = {count: 0}
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(counterReducer, initialState)
  const {count} = state
  const increment = () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

Our `counterReducer` _could_ be inlined as a function within the `Counter`
component itself and there's nothing wrong with this. It could be useful if you
wanted to make the reducer take props into account for example. But I personally
prefer to extract it. There's not really a significant benefit either way...

Our `counterReducer` is using a switch statement and this is pretty typical of
reducers, but it does not have to use a switch statement. You can do whatever
you like to there. What matters is that it gets passed the state and an argument
passed by dispatch. We're calling that argument "action" but you could call it
whatever you want and it doesn't even have to have a "type" property if you
don't want. All that said, this is a pretty typical example of a reducer.

The idea behind the reducer is that it handles most of the logic for your
component and your component simply invokes dispatch with all the data that the
reducer needs to do it's job.
